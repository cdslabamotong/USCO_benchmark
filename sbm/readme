Stochastic Bipartite Matching

This dataset is a complete graph with 128 nodes

bm_norm_30_128 contains the graph; each edge weight follows a beta distribution with parameter (alpha, beta).
Each line contains one edge: (node1, node2, alpha, beta, mean_weight)

bm_norm_30_128_train_10000_20 contains the node-set pairs, and their optmial matching.
Each line contains one pair ([left node set]:[right node set]: [optimal matching])

The features are follows:
