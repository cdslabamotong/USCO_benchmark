This dataset is based on Cora dataset.

dr_cora contains the graph: each edge weight follows a beta distribution with parameter (alpha, beta).
Each line contains one edge: (node1, node2, alpha, beta, mean_weight)

dr_cora_train_10000_0 contains the nodes pairs, and their shortest path.
Each line contains one pair ([input nodes], [solution by greedy algorithm])
